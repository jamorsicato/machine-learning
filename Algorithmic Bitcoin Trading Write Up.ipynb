    "1) why does this story need to ne told? I am sharing my bitcoin price prediction project becasue of the large influx of retail investors interested in crypto currency and machine learning. Using a CNN for use in algorithmic trading is a relatively new concept and think its could be very useful in the future of trading with a large enough data set\n",

    "2) Why am I sharing? I had a great time building this project and I think that it could be good inspiratation for better version of the project. I am also realatively new to machine learning and I think this project was outside of my comfort zone and could be a good for people to see\n",
