    "1) why does this story need to ne told? I am sharing my bitcoin price prediction project becasue of the large influx of retail investors interested in crypto currency and machine learning. Using a CNN for use in algorithmic trading is a relatively new concept and think its could be very useful in the future of trading with a large enough data set\n",
