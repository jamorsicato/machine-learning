    "__What is Artificial Intelligence (AI):__ The computer science definition is the study of *intelligence agents*. Any device that takes in input to maximize its decisions. Intelligence displayed by machines. The name for an AI that mimicks human inteligence is *Strong AI* or *Artificial General Inteligence (AGI)*. Coloquiolly people say AI is anything where a computer trys to mimic cognitive function. Often AI is anything that hasnt been done yet, we use to think if it a computer program could beet a human at chess that it would be AI, but thats obviously not true. AI is a more catch all term for the study of trying to replicate human inteligence, while machine learning is the study of building alogrithms that teach themselves.\n",

    "__What is Machine Learning (ML):__ The study of using compouter algorithms that automatically get better with experience. ML is apart of AI, but not AI is ML. ML models built a model based on a training set of data and test the model on a test set. All from data that is already gathered. A subset of ML that focuses on making predicitons with computers is closely realted to computational statistics. ML is also referred to as __Predictive Analytics__ in some fields.\n",

    "__What is Deep Learning:__ Deep learning is a subfield of ML that focuses on artificial neural networks. Deep learning may be a large missing piece in AGI when paired with faster or event quantum computer. Deep learning is essentially referring to a deep neural network \n",
