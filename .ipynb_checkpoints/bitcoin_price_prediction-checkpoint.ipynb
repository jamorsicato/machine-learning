    "I spend a lot of time climbing, playing music, and adventuring, but have started to miss my STEM roots. Machine learning application is something I feel naturally passionate about so I am doing all these projects for fun to discover if its something I want to persue. Please leave any comments and tell me what I need to improve!! Thank you! Also feel free to go critique my github, I could use any feedback I can get.\n",
